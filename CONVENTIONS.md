# Conventions:

1. Use British English.

2. Use concise names. In the case of Entities, TileEntities, Biomes and Dimensions, this means no suffixes: e.g. `Creeper` instead of `CreeperEntity`

3. Use outdated, cursed Mojang names where applicable. e.g Tile instead of Block

4. Notwithstanding these rules, the name must still make some sense

5. Setters have "set-" prefixes except in builders

6. Tile instead of Block (extension of rule 3 for methods to do with tiles)
