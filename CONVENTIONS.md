# Conventions:

1. Use British English.

2. Use concise names for Entities, TileEntities, Biomes and Dimensions. e.g. `Creeper` instead of `CreeperEntity`

3. Use outdated, cursed Mojang names where applicable. e.g Tile instead of Block

4. Notwithstanding these rules, the name must still make some sense
